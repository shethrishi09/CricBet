# CricBet 🏏

Just built a **full-stack cricket betting web app** entirely from scratch using **Django REST Framework for backend** and **React for frontend**, powered by a **Python web scraper** for live scores and odds.

## 📖 About the Project
This project was a great exercise in:  
- Building a full-stack web application from scratch  
- Integrating backend APIs with a React frontend  
- Fetching and displaying **live scores and betting odds** dynamically  

While it’s complex, it marks a solid step forward in my **full-stack development journey**, and I’m excited to keep leveling up my skills. 🚀
